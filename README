[COMPILING]-----------------------------------------------------------------

To compile Csound 5, you'll need a copy of the GNU Autotools, specifically 
autoconf.  

To compile, enter the root of the source tree (the same directory as this R
EADME file), and type:

autoconf

This will create and configure script file.  After this is done, type:

./configure

and the file will check your system to see if required libraries are 
available.  Optionally, if you type:

./configure --help

a list of additional commandline flags will be shown that you may use to 
customize the configure script.

After this completes, a Makefile will be generated. Now type:

make

and this will start the build process.
